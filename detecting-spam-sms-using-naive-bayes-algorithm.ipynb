SMS is a service provided by Mobile service providers using which Mobile users can send messages to other Mobile users. SMS stands for **Short Messaging Service**. Using SMS, Mobile users can send message which can at the most contain 160 characters. The messages can contain any character and can include hyperlinks.\n","\n","The model being built is a **Supervised Learning** model. In other words, we will feed data containing spam SMS and good SMS along with labels regarding which SMS is a spam SMS and which SMS is a good SMS into the machine and make the machine learn to detect spam SMS and good SMS. Once the model is ready, if we feed any SMS to the model, the model should respond by stating whether the input SMS is a spam SMS or a good SMS."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"772fa388","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-09-25T11:01:25.218285Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-09-25T11:01:25.217847Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-09-25T11:01:25.229183Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-09-25T11:01:25.227834Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.032076,"end_time":"2022-09-25T11:01:25.233266","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-09-25T11:01:25.20119","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["import warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b06d08d0","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.019104,"end_time":"2022-09-25T11:01:25.26895","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-09-25T11:01:25.249846","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["## Loading the data\n","\n","The first step in building a supervised learning model is to load the data based on which the model will be prepared.
